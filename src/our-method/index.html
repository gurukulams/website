The organization has a unique approach to training that sets it apart from others.</p><h3 id=picking-a-candidate>Picking a Candidate</h3><p>TECH@PARK identifies potential candidates through trusted sources, such as colleagues and ex-students, who know the candidate&rsquo;s potential personally. The organization then interviews candidates based on certain parameters to determine if they have the potential to succeed in the IT industry.</p><h3 id=team-farming>Team Farming</h3><p>Once a candidate is selected, they are expected to stay with the trainer and learn as a team. The trainer encourages team farming to help the candidates learn the engineering process. The students are involved in real-world projects, which can either be open source projects or from a potential hirer.</p><h3 id=pro-gramming>Pro-gramming</h3><p>The students are trained on the latest market trends and technologies by industry experts. There is no predefined training duration period. The training goes on until the student or trainer feels that the student is &ldquo;COMPLETE&rdquo;. While joining, the students may not be the same, but they will achieve it when they &ldquo;COMP(L)ETE&rdquo;.</p><h3 id=placement>Placement</h3><p>TECH@PARK reaches out to companies that need relevant skill sets. As a principle, the organization never recommends people, but only refers them. When both the company and student find themselves matching, then they pursue. The student becomes an alumni and a contributor in the course of action and stays connected with TECH@PARK ever after, as the network grows stronger and wider.</p></div><script type=module src=/src/js/app.js></script></body></html>
