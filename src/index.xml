The organization has a unique approach to training that sets it apart from others.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="picking-a-candidate">Picking a Candidate&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>TECH@PARK identifies potential candidates through trusted sources, such as colleagues and ex-students, who know the candidate&amp;rsquo;s potential personally. The organization then interviews candidates based on certain parameters to determine if they have the potential to succeed in the IT industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="team-farming">Team Farming&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once a candidate is selected, they are expected to stay with the trainer and learn as a team. The trainer encourages team farming to help the candidates learn the engineering process. The students are involved in real-world projects, which can either be open source projects or from a potential hirer.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
